📊 Arrays Project 💻

✨ Overview

This project allows users to perform various calculations on an array of integers. It accepts user input, validates the number of integers, and supports multiple operations to manipulate and analyze the array. Ideal for demonstrating foundational knowledge in arrays, user input handling, and algorithmic operations in C.

🛠 Features

User Input Validation ✅

Prompts users to enter between 5 to 12 integers.
Ensures proper validation of array size and integer input.
Array Operations 📈

🔢 Print: Displays the array and its elements.
🏆 Max: Finds and displays the largest value in the array.
🔄 Reverse: Displays the array in reverse order.
➕ Sum: Calculates and displays the sum of all elements in the array.
📊 Sorted: Sorts the array in descending order and displays it.
🔄 Swap: Swaps the first and last elements of the array and shows the updated array.
